# Dining-Philosopher-Problem-in-C
Description of the C Program: Dining Philosopher Problem
The Dining Philosopher Problem is a classic synchronization and concurrency problem in computer science, originally formulated by Edsger Dijkstra in 1965. It illustrates the challenges of allocating resources among multiple processes without causing deadlock or starvation. The problem involves five philosophers sitting around a circular table, each alternating between thinking and eating. Between each pair of philosophers is a single fork, and a philosopher needs both adjacent forks to eat.

Program Overview
This C program provides a solution to the Dining Philosopher Problem using threads and synchronization mechanisms such as mutexes and condition variables. The main goal is to ensure that no philosopher starves, and that the system avoids deadlock.

Key Components
Philosopher Struct:

Contains information about each philosopher, such as their ID and their state (thinking, hungry, or eating).
Forks and Mutexes:

An array of mutexes representing the forks. Each fork is shared between two adjacent philosophers.
Mutexes are used to ensure that only one philosopher can pick up a fork at a time, preventing race conditions.
Thread Functions:

Each philosopher is represented by a thread running a function that alternates between thinking and trying to eat.
The function checks the availability of the forks and picks them up if both are free, simulating the eating process.
Condition Variables:

Condition variables may be used to signal when a philosopher can proceed to pick up forks or must wait, facilitating communication between threads to avoid deadlock.
Synchronization Mechanisms:

The program employs various synchronization techniques to ensure that philosophers can eat without causing deadlock or starvation. This includes checking the status of adjacent philosophers and ensuring mutual exclusion when accessing shared resources.
Example Workflow
Initialization:

Initialize the philosophers and forks (mutexes).
Create threads for each philosopher, each running the philosopher's main routine.
Philosopher Routine:

A philosopher alternates between thinking and trying to pick up the forks.
When hungry, the philosopher checks if both adjacent forks are available.
If the forks are available, the philosopher picks them up and starts eating.
After eating, the philosopher puts down the forks and returns to thinking.
Termination:

The program can be set to run for a specific duration or number of iterations, after which it gracefully terminates the threads and cleans up resources.
Challenges Addressed
Deadlock Prevention:

The program ensures that no circular wait conditions arise, which are necessary for deadlock. Various strategies, such as picking up both forks simultaneously or using an asymmetric approach (odd/even philosopher IDs), can be implemented.
Starvation Avoidance:

By using condition variables or checking neighboring states, the program ensures that each philosopher gets a chance to eat, thus avoiding starvation.
This C program demonstrates essential concepts in concurrent programming and synchronization, providing a practical solution to the Dining Philosopher Problem while highlighting the importance of careful resource management in multi-threaded environments.
